c OVERALL LAPS PARAMETERS
c Many of these are stored in the common block in 'lapsparms.cmn'
c
c NX_L_CMN    - number of grid points in the horizontal direction
c 
c NY_L_CMN    - number of grid points in the vertical direction
c
c laps_cycle_time_cmn - LAPS cycle time in seconds. This should correspond
c                       to the interval between cron entries that run the
c                       'sched.pl' script.
c
c l_compress_radar - Compress "vxx" radar files using run-length encoding.
c                    Note that this is experimental and departs from the 
c                    NetCDF file convention
c
c l_use_tamdar - Flag to decide on the use of TAMDAR ACARS data. This flag
c                functions only when the NIMBUS database is being used.
c                For the WFO database, the TAMDAR data is always allowed 
c                through if it is available.
c
c maxstns_cmn - max number of sfc stations you are likely to encounter in the
c             - LSO file and various analyses, in and near the domain.
c             - used in obs_driver.x, sfc_qc.exe, laps_sfc.x, and others?
c
c path_to_soil_2m - this parameter is not yet active since we do not yet
c                   supply the soil type database. It is there only for
c                   software testing at this time.
c
c c8_project_common - Depends on which "realization" of LAPS you are running.
c                     This sends information to various programs on things
c                     like file formats, filename conventions, etc. Most 
c                     references to 'c8_project_common' are in the ingest
c                     routines, though it also controls other specialized 
c                     functions for 'AIRDROP'. Allowed values are 'NIMBUS', 
c                     'WFO', 'AFWA', 'CWB', 'RSA', and 'AIRDROP'.
c
c radarext_3d_cmn - Determines input radar source for the cloud analysis.
c                   Intermediate files used are already on the LAPS grid.
c                   'all' first use 'vrz' 3D mosaic, then merge in 'lapsprd/vrc'
c                   'a01' first use 'v01' volume data, then merge in 'lapsprd/vrc'
c                   'v01' (radar #1  volume data)
c                   'v02' (radar #2  volume data)
c                   'vxx' (radar #xx volume data)
c                   'vrc' (2d radar data [e.g. NOWRAD, NEXRAD Lvl 3 narrowband])
c
c radarext_3d_accum_cmn - Determines input radar source for precip accum analysis.
c                         Intermediate files used are already on the LAPS grid.
c                         'xxx' Choose 'vrc' or 'all' automatically based on
c                               availability and frequency of 'vrc/vrz'.
c                         'vrc' (2d radar data in lapsprd directory [e.g. NOWRAD, 
c                                                     NEXRAD Lvl 3, narrowband]  )
c                         'vrz' (radar volume mosaic data)
c                         'all' first use 'vrz', then merge in 'lapsprd/vrc'
c                               at the times 'vrz' is present
c                         'v01' (radar #1  volume data)
c                         'v02' (radar #2  volume data)
c                         'vxx' (radar #xx volume data)
c
c MAX_RADARS_CMN - Number of wideband radars being used. This can be set to
c                  0 if no radars are present to save computer memory 
c                  (particularly in the wind analysis) along with other 
c                  resources.
c
c max_radar_files_cmn - Maximum number of files expected in a radar directory
c
c ref_base_cmn - Reflectivity dbZ value assigned to areas with no echoes.
c
c ref_base_useable_cmn - Threshold dbZ used to filter out low reflectivities 
c                        thus acting as a ground clutter and noise filter.
c                        Areas with reflectivities < 'ref_base_useable_cmn'
c                        are generally reset to 'ref_base_cmn' (no echo 
c                        value).
c                      
c r_hybrid_first_gate_cmn - Flag to mask out gates near the radar for low tilts to 
c                           emulate what happens with the hybrid reflectivity scan.
c                           Allowed values are 0.0 (flag off) or 1.0 (flag on).
c
c aircraft_time_window_cmn - Time window (half width) for accepting aircraft 
c                            data in both the PIN file and in the analyses. 
c                            Measured as a fraction of 'laps_cycle_time'.
c
c
c fdda_model_source_cmn - Enter the forecast model if you'd like to use
c                         one for 4DDA (as a substitute for lga/lgb input
c                         to the analyses). Examples are 'mm5', 'eta', etc. 
c                         This corresponds to the available 'lapsprd/fua/*'
c                         subdirectories. Lapsplot will plot only among those
c                         listed elements.
c
c TERRAIN SMOOTHING
c           
c toptwvl_parm_cmn: 
c     As an example, 4 would represent 4 delta-x filtering of the terrain. You 
c     can change this to alter the smoothness of the terrain. Higher numbers 
c     mean smoother terrain.
c
c silavwt_parm_cmn : 
c     This parameter allows the potential use of silhouette terrain which is 
c     the maximum elevation in the local area. Useful range is anywhere 
c     between 0-1. A value of zero uses the average terrain instead of the 
c     maximum. Note that a value of 1 may reduce the apparent effect of 
c     filtering with 'toptwvl_parm'.
