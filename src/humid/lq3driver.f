      program lq3driver

c     routine to automatically execute routines lpw_driver1a & b for the laps
c     scheduler.
c
c     note, it is essential that this module be executed in the laps exe
c     path position ... its path location is vital to its proper execution
c
c
c     it is also strongly recommended that this and the associated moisture
c     modules be compiled with the highest permissible optimization.
c     especially the satellite structure inclusion can take up to 1/2 hour
c     of cpu time when run without optimization.
