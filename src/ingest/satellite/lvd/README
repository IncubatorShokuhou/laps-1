                       Overview:
                     ------------

The lvd code is written to read a  block of satellite data for
the laps domain and with dynamic memory. The lvd_sat_ingest.exe
process requires mapping look-up-tables that are produced by
genlvdlut.exe. The genlvdlut code is in subdirectory table. The
satellite data block are defined by the start/end values in the
namelist (static/satellite_lvd.nl).

An enhancement in lvd is that if the lut's do not exist then
they will automatically get generated. This was possible by putting
the lut code into lib/satellite. The genlvdlut.exe process still
runs as before.  Eventually it will be possible for lvd_sat_ingest.exe
to test if the satellite mapping table need rebuilding due to
a relocation of domain or a change in the satellite navigation. This is
now functional. One drawback though is that all lut's known to the
system (as specified by the ISATS, ITYPES namelist variables) are
generated.

The LAPS satellite ingest creates an intermediate file with
extension "lvd". The process, lvd_sat_ingest (lsi for short)
uses the satellite namelist data/static/satellite_lvd.nl. The
namelist works in conjunction with a data include file
src/include/sat_data_static.inc which contains static information
relevant to lsi.  LAPS library routine config_satellite_lvd (in file
lapsgrid.f) loads the common block defined in src/include/satellite
_common_lvd.inc.  Recall, the information in the common block is
referenced by the namelist variables ISATS, ITYPES, and ICHANNELS.
Therefore, the user only needs to modify those variables
and everything else is taken care of automatically.

The lvd output is in a specific satellite_id subdirectory (currently
goes08 and goes09. This new output path allows lvd to process more
that one satellite concurrently.  Both GOES08 and GOES09 will be
processed if namelist variable ISATS = 1,1. Only GOES08 data is processed
if ISATS = 1,0.


                      RAW Satellite Data
                     ------------------

lvd accepts goes08 or goes09 satellite data in several formats: 

    1. netcdf: (remapped fsl-conus [lambert] and raw gvar).
    2. wfo: also netcdf and lambert projection. Data from SBN.
    3. gwc: AirForce Global Weather Center. 

                     Selection of Channels
                     ---------------------

The lvd can process a variable number of channels, from just 1 to all 5.
There are 4 IR channels and 1 visible channel. The user can modify the
ICHANNELS namelist variable to direct lvd_sat_ingest to the desired data.
The 0's and 1's correspond to the ISATS, ITYPES settings so the user need
not worry about all values depending on which satellites and which types
the system is designed to read.


                         Look-Up-Table
                         -------------

The luts are now generated internally by lvd. If an lut does not exist,
then ALL of them are generated.
If a parameter in the satellite_lvd.nl has changed then the luts are re-
generated.  This code is still somewhat experimental but is functioning as
expected as of 3-28-98.
