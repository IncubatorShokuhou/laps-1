Right.  Also, we talked about how we might get this to work more optimally 
for real-time.  Any alternative likely will involve additional resources, 
either in hardware or manpower.  A hardware solution would involve getting
a faster processor.  However, that still leaves the issue of moving/handling the
14.5 MB netCDF files.  I guess I'd recommend looking at how those files are
created.  In particular, I suggest writing byte values instead of floats.
That cuts your file size by 4x and probably greatly improves compressability.
Another idea that may help for real-time processing would be to kick off a
separate process to do the end-of-volume stuff so that the tilt-by-tilt
processing can proceed without waiting.

As to who (or how much) is available to do what's needed...

     Bob also mentioned that a FORTRAN driver may fix the "MAIN error".

Steve,

If you need to run the wideband ingest program on yucca,
I think you should be able to cd ~lipschut/wideband/bin
and then run widebd_client in that directory.  If 
that doesn't work (because of permissions), copy
these two files to your own directory and run widebd_client.

~lipschut/wideband/bin/widebd_client 
~lipschut/wideband/bin/nexrad.cfg

Also, I happened to find a program called wideband_scan
sitting in you remap directory.  It reads from the
circular buffer and prints out current scan information.
You should be able to run that one as 
~lipschut/wideband/bin/wideband_scan.

	...see ya in a week.

Hi, Steve.  The widebd_client program was not running when I came in
Monday morning.  I don't know why.  That certainly would explain
why you weren't seeing data.

I have not yet persued how to make widebd_client "operational."  
Ultimately, it should run out of an operational account, with auto-startup 
when the system reboots.  I'd also like to add some better monitoring and 
reporting.

For the time being I have just been running it from my account.  
You could also run it... perhaps that might be preferred, since you're 
also looking at the data.  At least you should be able to start it if 
you find that it isn't up.  When you have a moment to experiment, let 
me know, so I can kill my process.  Then you could try running:

	~lipschut/bin/widebd_client &

You'll need to run this from your own writable directory since 
widebd_client (for now, anyway) creates a log file in the 
current working directory.
