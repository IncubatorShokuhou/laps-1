	function ssh(p,t)
c
c   this function returns saturation specific humidity ssh (grams of 
c   water vapor per kilogram of moist air) given the pressure p
c   (millibars) and the temperature t (celsius). the equation is given
c   in standard meteorological texts. if t is dew point (celsius), then
c   ssh returns the actual specific humidity.
