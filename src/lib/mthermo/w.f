	function w(t,p)
c
c   this function returns the mixing ratio (grams of water vapor per
c   kilogram of dry air) given the temperature t (celsius) and pressure
c   (millibars). the formula is quoted in most meteorological texts.
c
c   if t is the ambient temperature the routine returns saturation mixing
c   ratio. if t is the dewpoint temperature the routine returns the actual
c   mixing ratio.
