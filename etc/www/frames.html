Animations can be made by selecting a #Frames value greater than 1. Time
intervals are counted in terms of the analysis cycle time.
These images are animated GIF files. They can be downloaded onto disk
from this "on-the-fly" page and used for things like powerpoint files or other web displays.
<p>
Animation frame rate is controlled by the "Delay" setting where the frame
interval is in hundredths of a second (e.g. 100 = 1.00 seconds).
