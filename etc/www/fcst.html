<h2>Forecast Time:</h2>
This can be left blank and the web page will automatically find
the most recent model forecast valid at the desired time.
<p>
If you want
a specific forecast run 
enter the model initialization time <strong>yydddhhmm</strong> (e.g. 090011200
for a Jan 1 12z model run).
<p>
Alternately enter the <strong>hhmm</strong> format of the forecast time (e.g. 0600 for a 6-hour forecast). 
This is the interval of
time between the model initialization and the forecast valid time.


<h3>Other non-forecast uses of "forecast" window...</h3>
<center><h4>Radar data</h4></center>
<p>
One "trick" is that you can enter 'vrz', 'vrc', 'v01', 'v02', etc., for the forecast and
display intermediate radar files, if 'obs' and reflectivity are selected
for the "Source" and "Field", respectively.
<p>
A related trick is that you can enter the radar number (e.g. '1' or '0' for all), 
for the forecast and display radial velocity from
intermediate radar files, if 'obs' and 'radial_vel'
are selected for the "Source" and "Field", respectively. 
'Valid Time' should also be set. Note that the sequence leaves out radars that have no valid velocity data,
so there may not be a one-to-one correspondence with 'v01', 'v02', etc.

<center><h4>Satellite data</h4></center>
<p>
You can also enter the satellite name (e.g. 'goes12') for the forecast and
display intermediate LVD satellite files, if 'obs' is selected for the "Source".

<center><h4>Static geography data</h4></center>
<p>
Another trick is that if 'GG/gg' is entered as the 'Field', the type of
static field can be entered here in the 'Fcst' window (e.g. 'gn' for Green Fraction).
