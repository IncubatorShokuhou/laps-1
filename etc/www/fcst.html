<h2>Forecast:</h2>
This can be left blank and the web page will automatically find
the latest forecast (if any are available) valid at the desired time.
Otherwise, 
if you want
a specific forecast run, 
enter the 'hhmm' format of the forecast time (e.g. 0600). 
This is the interval of
time between the model initialization and the forecast valid time.

<h3>Other uses of "forecast" window...</h3>
<p>
One "trick" is that you can enter 'v01', 'v02' for the forecast and
display intermediate radar files, if 'obs' is selected
for the "Source".
<p>
You can also enter the satellite name (e.g. 'goes12') for the forecast and
display LVD satellite files, if 'obs' is selected for the "Source".
<p>
Another trick is that if 'GG/gg' is entered as the 'Field', the type of
static field can be entered here in the 'Fcst' window (e.g. 'gn' for Green Fraction).
