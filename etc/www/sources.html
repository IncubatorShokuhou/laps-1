<h2>Source(s):</h2>
Click on one or more entries to specify data sources.

<h3>bkgnd:</h3>
Plot model background fields used as the analysis first guess. These are
remapped onto the LAPS grid in the LGA/LGB files.

<h3>mm5, etc:</h3>
Plot model forecast fields that were initialized with LAPS analyses (FUA/FSF
files)

<p>
Note: an asterisk after a source indicates it is the preferred background for
use in the analyses.

<h3>DIFF/diff:</h3>

To difference two fields, click also on the lower-case 'diff' to add an 
overlay with the difference field. The last two source/field/level overlays will be
used for the difference. This should work for most fields, except for wind 
barbs and wind speed. Clicking on the upper-case 'DIFF' will produce a
difference image. The overlays for the two fields being differenced will
not be plotted for this image option. When doing differences it is recommended
to use only lower case "Field" selections.
<p>
On some machines (e.g. PCs with windows) you may need to hold down the 
CTRL key while clicking for multiple choices with the mouse.


<h3>obs:</h3>


<p>
Show observation plots (surface or upper level).
For observation plots at upper levels, here is the color scheme:
<ul>
<li>Wind
<ul>
<li>Lavender - Profiler, Tower, Dropsonde
<li>Red - RAOB
<li>Light Blue - ACARS (at the level)
<li>Dark Blue - ACARS (near the level)
<li>Light Blue (small barbs) - Surface Obs (at the level)
<li>Dark Blue (small barbs) - Surface Obs (near the level)
<li>Yellow - Cloud Drift Winds (at the level)
<li>Grey - Cloud Drift Winds (off the level)
<li>Radar - Radial velocity is shown as red (receding) and green (approaching) grid squares while
    derived radar vectors are shown as small yellow wind barbs
</ul>
</ul><ul>

<li>Temperature
<ul>
<li>Aqua - RASS
<li>Yellow - RAOB, Radiometer
<li>Deep Blue - Dropsonde
<li>Magenta - Satellite Soundings (e.g. GOES)
<li>Violet - POES Satellite Soundings
<li>Red - ACARS
</ul>
</ul>
