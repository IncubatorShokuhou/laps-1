<h2>Valid Time:</h2>
For an analysis or forecast, type in the desired valid time <strong>yydddhhmm</strong>. 
If you leave it blank, the
latest analysis time will be assumed.
<p>
For animations where the number of frames > 1 the valid time represents
the end of the loop.
<p>
Note that forecast valid time (initial time plus forecast duration)
is used in lieu of model initialization time.
This makes it easier for the web page to time match forecasts with analyses
and observations.
