changed by: Steve Albers
date:  6-28-1997 0130 UTC
changes: lapsgrid.f/get_laps_cycle_time - mods to obtain LAPS_DOMAIN_NAME 
                    parameter from include file 'laps_static_parameter.inc'
         lapsgrid.f/get_laps_dimensions - added better error handling and

file(s): source/accum/{laps_accum,laps_accum_sub}.f
         source/accum/doit
changed by: Ken Dritz / Steve Albers
date:  6-30-1997 1900 UTC
changes: Made resizable by adding calls to the main program in laps_accum.f to
         get the grid dimensions, which are then passed to subroutine
         laps_accum in laps_accum_sub.f as NX_L, NY_L, and NZ_L.  In the
         latter, non-dummy arrays dimensioned by NX_L, NY_L, and NZ_L
         (previously obtained statically from 'lapsparms.for') thus become
         automatic arrays.  Changed include of 'lapsparms.for' to
         'laps_static_parameters.inc' in subroutine laps_accum.

file(s): ./humid/analq.f
changed by: Dan Birkenheuer
date:  7/1/97 16:00 ut
changes: Enabled automatic dynamic allocation in this module.  It is now
         independent from lapsparms.for.

         lib/get_systime.f
         lib/Makefile
changed by: Steve Albers
date:  7-1-1997 2040 UTC
changes: Removed include of 'lapsparms.for' in subroutine 'insert_radar'. 
         Variable 'ref_base' is now passed into subroutine 'insert_radar'.
         New library routine (at least for 'oldlaps') 'get_systime' to allow
         better interchangeability with 'newlaps' software. The 'newlaps'
         version of 'get_systime' will need to be synced with the 'oldlaps'
         version.

file(s): source/temp/puttmpanal_drv.f
changed by: Ken Dritz / Steve Albers
date:  7-2-1997 1800 UTC
changes: Made resizable by adding calls to the main program in puttmpanal_drv.f
         to get the grid dimensions, which are then passed to subroutine
         laps_temp in the same file (as NX_L, NY_L, NZ_L).  In the latter,
         non-dummy arrays dimensioned by NX_L, NY_L, and NZ_L (previously
         obtained statically from 'lapsparms.for') thus become automatic
         arrays.  Added include of 'laps_static_paramters.inc' to the main
         program, and changed include of 'lapsparms.for' to
         'laps_static_parameters.inc' in subroutine laps_temp.
         Used new 'get_systime' routine call.

file(s): source/temp/puttmpanal.f
changed by: Ken Dritz
date:  7-2-1997 1800 UTC
changes: Made resizable by changing NZ_L_MAX to nk in declarations of theta and
         height, thus making those arrays automatic.  Removed include of
         'lapsparms.for'.

file(s): source/temp/insert_tsnd.f
changed by: Ken Dritz
date:  7-2-1997 1800 UTC
changes: Made resizable by changing NZ_L_MAX to nk in subroutines insert_tsnd,
         analyze_tsnd, and barnes_univariate_shell, thus making some arrays
         automatic; by calling get_r_missing_data in insert_tsnd to obtain the
         value of r_missing_data, and by passing the latter from insert_tsnd to
         read_tsnd and analyze_tsnd, and from analyze_tsnd to
         barnes_univariate_shell; and by removing include of 'lapsparms.for' in
         insert_tsnd, analyze_tsnd, and barnes_univariate_shell.

file(s): source/temp/read_tsnd.f
changed by: Ken Dritz
date:  7-2-1997 1800 UTC
changes: Made resizable by changing NZ_L_MAX to kmax in declaration of ob_pr_t,
         thus making this array automatic.  Added r_missing_data as dummy
         argument (passed by insert_tsnd).  Removed include of 'lapsparms.for'.

file(s): source/wind/main.f
changed by: Ken Dritz / Steve Albers (tested and integrated by Steve Albers)
date:  7-7-1997 2100 UTC
changes: Made resizable by changing program laps_wind into subroutine
         laps_wind_sub and creating a new program laps_wind.  The latter calls
         get_laps_config, get_grid_dim_xy, and get_laps_dimensions to get the
         values of NX_L, NY_L, and NZ_L, which are passed to laps_wind_sub.
         The arrays declared there, with these bounds, thus become automatic
         arrays.  Removed include of 'lapsparms.for' from subroutine
         laps_wind_sub.  Pass NX_L, NY_L, and NZ_L from laps_wind_sub to
         lapswind_anal (in main_sub.f).  In laps_wind_sub, added calls to
         get_max_radars, get_meso_sao_pirep, get_r_missing_data, and
         get_i2_missing_data to obtain the values of max_radars, N_MESO, N_SAO,
         N_PIREP, r_missing_data, and i2_missing_data, which are also passed to
         lapswind_anal.  Max_radars and r_missing_data are passed to
         put_derived_wind_prods as well, and NX_L, NY_L, and NZ_L are passed a
         second time to put_derived_wind_prods (so that they are available
         there under those names as well as under the names imax, jmax, and
         kmax, ALL of which are used as dimensions of arrays that are now
         becoming automatic arrays in put_derived_wind_prods).

file(s): source/wind/main_sub.f
changed by: Ken Dritz (tested and integrated by Steve Albers)
date:  7-7-1997 2100 UTC
changes: Made resizable by adding NX_L, NY_L, NZ_L, max_radars, N_MESO, N_SAO,
         and N_PIREP as dummy arguments, thus making arrays declared with those
         dimensions (including in 'main_sub.inc') automatic.  Changed include
         of 'lapsparms.for' to include of 'laps_static_parameters.inc'.
         Removed NZ_L_MAX from the argument list in the call to get_fg_wind,
         where it is not actually used.  Changed RETURN statement to STOP
         statement in handling of istatus .ne. 1 after return from call to
         get_domain_laps (bug fix).  Removed PARAMETER declarations of NPTS and
         K_3D (defined in terms of NX_L, NY_L, NZ_L), which were unused.  Also
         added r_missing_data and i2_missing_data as dummy arguments.  Pass
         N_MESO twice in the call to rdmeso (once to dummy argument N_MESO and
         once to maxstns, both newly added).  Pass N_SAO twice in the call to
         rdsao (once to dummy argument N_SAO and once to maxstns, both newly
         added).  Pass N_PIREP in the call to rdpirep.  Pass NX_L and NY_L a
         second time in the call to vert_wind (once to ni,nj and once to newly
         added dummy arguments NX_L_MAX and NY_L_MAX).  Pass r_missing_data to
         vert_wind.

changed by: Ken Dritz (tested and integrated by Steve Albers)
date:  7-7-1997 2100 UTC
changes: Made resizable by adding NX_L, NY_L, NZ_L as dummy arguments in
         subroutine get_wind_3d_obs, thus making arrays declared with those
         dimensions (including in 'get_wind_obs.inc') automatic.  Also added
         r_missing_data and i2_missing_data as dummy arguments of
         get_wind_3d_obs.

file(s): source/ingest/pireps/ingest_pireps.f
changed by: Ken Dritz / Steve Albers
date:  7-18-1997 2000 UTC
changes: Made the pireps ingest resizable by (among other things) adding a call
         to get_grid_dim_xy to get the values of NX_L and NY_L, which are then
         passed to get_pirep_data in file ingest_pireps_sub.f. Also fixed some
         things to make the handling of i4time within the routine more 
         straightforward.

         source/grid/model/Makefile
changed by: Steve Albers
date:  8-1-97 1830 UTC
changes: Subroutines in gridgen_model.f rearranged and some are split off into
         a new file (map_proj.f). Makefile is accordingly modified. This lays
         some groundwork for future mods with added projections. The output
         of gridgen_model.exe should be unaffected by this change.
         
         Some new subroutines:
             latlon_to_xy     - combines getops and pstoxy
             xy_to_latlon     - combines xytops and pstoge
             xy_to_uv         - not used yet
             uv_to_xy         - not used yet

changed by: Steve Albers
date:  8-5-97 2100 UTC
changes: Now automatically determines whether we are using NIMBUS or AFGWC
         formats by keying on the filenames. Output files now always go in
         'snd' directory, soft link to 'snd_af' directory no longer needed.
         Now reports an error if it cannot open the output 'snd' file.

changed by: Ken Dritz (tested and integrated by Steve Albers)
date:  8-6-97 1800 UTC
changes: Made resizable by changes noted in comments at the top of each source
         file. All parameters formerly obtained from 'lapsparms.for' are now
         obtained at runtime. Analogous changes were made to the files
         in 'source/deriv'.

file(s): src/lib/lapsgrid.f
changed by: Steve Albers
date:  8-11-97 1900 UTC
changes: Uncommented the line in 'get_laps_config' that tests for 
         'iflag_lapsparms_cmn'. This is more efficient if 'get_laps_config'
         is called multiple times.
         Added new parameter access subroutine 'get_c80_description'.
